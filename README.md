# A Neural Network Approach for Online Nonlinear Neyman-Pearson Classification
This is the repository for Online Nonlinear Neyman Pearson (NP) Classifier described in [1]: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9265182. 
Proposed model is an online, nonlinear NP classifier. In NP framework, the target is to maximize detection power while upper-bounding the false alarm.
Using this repository, you can test and train the model. Note that available code does not cover hyper-parameter tuning.


# Running the Model
NPNN code is implemented in matlab and this repo is executable by running NPNN.m

# Evaluating the results
Running the model will generate 4 different graphs. As shown below

# Running the Model with a new data set

# Hyperparameter Tuning
